        <br>
        <p>Battle Royale is a mode with a total of 60 players in each match. In Trios, it is divided into twenty squads of three, and in Duo, thirty squads of two. The goal of each match is to be the last squad standing; If one player makes it to the end, the whole squad shares the win. The match starts with all players in the dropship, flying in a straight line over the map. Players are then allowed to parachute onto the map as they please, led by their squad's Jumpmaster, then the match resumes where there will be a zone circle that can reduce player blood and players are required to survive from other zones and squads until there is until the last team survives.</p>
